The idea for Algorand was born in 2017 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when a small group of world-class cryptographers and engineers gathered around the kitchen table at the home of Silvio Micali. The Turing Award-winning cryptographer and esteemed MIT computer-science professor had been studying the technical limitations of so-called “second generation” blockchains. Having co-created a slew of concepts foundational to modern cryptography – from probabilistic encryption to zero-knowledge proofs to verifiable random functions – Micali saw an inspiring challenge: to design an environmentally-friendly blockchain that could facilitate enterprise-grade scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization.
